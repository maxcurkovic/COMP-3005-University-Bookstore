The database used for this project is included in the "101139937_3005A6.zip" file.

Once extracted into a folder, the "3005Proj.db" file is also located in the same folder as all of the other files (the root folder).

I have included "sqlite3.exe" in the zip file for easy access of the databse through the cmd terminal. 
The "main.py" Python script can also be ran using the cmd terminal, or opened in a notepad software of your choosing for the source code.
